#  Plant Disease Detection from Leaf Images

##  Objective
Detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images using a CNN model built with Keras and deploy it via a Streamlit GUI.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy / Matplotlib
- Streamlit
- PlantVillage Dataset

---

##  Dataset
- Source: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Used 4â€“5 disease classes for training
- Dataset split into: `train/`, `val/`

---

##  Model Summary
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) built using Keras
- Image size: 128x128
- Image normalization applied
- Trained for ~10 epochs
- Model saved as `plant_disease_model.h5`

---

##  Image Preprocessing
- Resize to 128x128
- Normalize pixel values
- Augmentation (flip, rotation) applied to training set

---

##  Streamlit GUI
- Upload leaf image via Streamlit
- Display prediction: Disease Class
- Shows uploaded image and result
- Run the app:
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
